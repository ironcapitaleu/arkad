//! # Transition Error Types
//!
//! This module defines the [`Transition`] error enum, representing errors that can occur during state transitions
//! within a state machine. These errors are used throughout the SEC state machine framework to provide
//! strongly-typed, descriptive error handling for transition operations.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The [`Transition`] enum covers two main failure scenarios:
//! - [`FailedOutputConversion`](Transition::FailedOutputConversion): Occurs when the output data of the source state cannot be converted into the input data of the destination state.
//! - [`FailedContextConversion`](Transition::FailedContextConversion): Occurs when the context data of the source state cannot be converted into the context data of the destination state.
//!
//! These errors are intended to be used by implementers of the [`Transition`](crate::traits::state_machine::transition::Transition) trait
//! and are surfaced by the state machine error handling system (see [`crate::error`] and [`crate::error::state_machine`]).
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! These error types are typically returned by transition logic in the state machine implementation, and can be
//! matched against to provide detailed diagnostics or recovery strategies.
//!
//! ## Related Modules
//! - [`crate::error`]: Top-level error types for the SEC state machine library.
//! - [`crate::error::state_machine`]: Error types specific to state machine operations.
//! - [`crate::traits::state_machine::transition`]: The trait defining transition behavior in the state machine framework.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use sec::error::state_machine::transition::Transition;
//!
//! fn perform_transition() -> Result<(), Transition> {
//!     // ... transition logic ...
//!     Err(Transition::FailedOutputConversion)
//! }
//! ```
